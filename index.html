					<h3>About me</h3>

				<ul>
					<hr align="left">
					<li>
						<h4>Who am I?</h4>
						<p>I play many roles including husband, father and most 
						recently, a student of <a href="https://perpetual.education/" target="perpetual">Perpetual Education</a> online school, where I am learning how to design the web. 
						I'm a native Houstonian thinking of possibly making 
						the move to the Pacific Northwest.</p>
					</li>
					<hr align="left">
					<li>
						<h4>What I can do?</h4>
						<p>I've been working on honing my web design skills, building	responsive sites, graphic designs, HTML and CSS. As I learn 	new techniques and languages, I will display them on this 		live site, which I welcome you to revisit to check out my 		progress.</p>
					</li>
					<hr align="left">
					<li>
						<h4>Why am I doing this?</h4>
						<p>I want to live a purposeful life. For me, this means 
						doing something I am passionate about and serving 
						others. The digital divide continues to affect 
						underprivileged communities. I hope that as I grow 
						and succeed in my web design career, I can also help 
						younger generations that don't have access to 
						technology find opportunities in this field.</p>
					</li>

						journey at <a href="https://stevedeanda.substack.com/" target="substack">Substack</a>.</p></li>
