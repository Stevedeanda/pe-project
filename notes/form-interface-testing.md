## [Andy](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-4/andy/projects/e4p/)


1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?
		- Easy to find.

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		- The page could use some formatting, everything is up in the top-left corner.
		- It has an explanation of what the page is for, easy for first time visitors to understand.
		- Links are clear but could use some styling.


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		- Forms are clear.

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		- Boxes are nice and big and the labels are legible.

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?
		- I wasn't able to break it.
		- The Hello World allows me to put symbols and numbers in the box. Not sure if that was on purpose or not.

	- Is the outcome clear?
		- Yes.

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?
		- Yes.

	- Is it pleasure to use?
		- I like to use them, they are eligible and make sense to me.

	- What could be improved?
		- I think the index page could use some styling and formatting.
		- Give the forms some padding at the top so it's not all the way up.
		- The buttons could be made to go with the style you got.


3. **Final Thoughts**

	- I think it looks good overall, It makes sense what you trying to convey and it's legible. Great job!




## [Burooj](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-4/burooj/projects/e4p/)


1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?
		- Easy to find

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		- Looks great, not clear what is happening, my wife thought they were exercises for people to do.
		- Maybe a description that they are forms to be filled out and not an exercise they are going to do.
		- Links are clear and fun


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		- It is minimalistic and can be vague. I know what they are suppose to do but I showed my wife and she wasn't sure what to do, she hovered over the "who" and it changed so she clicked on it, but nothing happen. I told her to click on "what is your name" and she was like oh, there is the box. Have the boxes be visible if they hover over "what is your name" or just have them there visible.

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		- They are easy on the eyes and legible. I like them. 

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?
		- I think it would be great if the values stayed put in the "Simple Math", "Retirement Calculator", and "Area of a Rectangular Room", in case they want to edit the number they don't have to re-enter the whole number. 
		- Not a big fan of the clickable feet and meter in "Area of a Rectangular Room", I try to click it but it moves. Have to try multiple times just to click which measurement I want to use. Like it doesn't want to get clicked.
		- I wasn't able to break it. 

	- Is the outcome clear?
		- Yes, I like how it results come out in yellow.

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?
		- Yes 

	- Is it pleasure to use?
		- Yes, I enjoy them.

	- What could be improved?
		- Give it more direction for first time users and the input boxes, visible.


3. **Final Thoughts**

	- I like the animation and detail you put into each part of the project. I am not sure how you got it to show the numbers on the side of each form in the index but that was a nice touch. How you hid the boxes I thought was clever but I can see how some first time users would miss that. I like how the font changes, great use of the hover state. Amazing job! 




## [Jesse](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-4/jesse/projects/e4p/)

1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?
		- Easy to find

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		- The index page is great, love the color scheme.
		- I think it's clear what it is, form practice is a good indicator how what to expect.
		- Links are clear


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?
		- In the "Self-Checkout" in the price it won't let me use decimals. I found a fix for this, you can add the attribute step to allow decimals to be inputted. `step=0.01` that should let you use decimals to the tenth place.
		- The "Counting Characters" does the same thing mine does. I don't think is right because it counts the space between words. If I input "1234 5678" then it should give me 8 character count but it gives me 9. I think you used Strlen function, which is the one I used. I need to find out how Burooj did it because his works.
		- I think the return button could be smaller, on some of the forms, you push the button to see the results but you can't see them because you have to scroll down and people can miss the results. Give it more padding at the bottom or make the return button a bit smaller.  

	- Is the outcome clear?
		- I think it could be clearer, the contrast is good but they are a bit small. When you get the results, the resluts and the array at the bottom might be a bit confusing. My wife was like what is that. Maybe make the results different style than the array. 

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?
		- Yes

	- Is it pleasure to use?
		- I like it, the animation on the buttons is my favorite part.

	- What could be improved?
		- I made some notes on the earlier questions. 
		- Ability to use decimals in the price of food in "Self-checkout".
		- Make the results more visible and differentiate the results and array.
		- Maybe make the home button smaller.


3. **Final Thoughts**
	- I enjoyed the color scheme on this one and the animations on the button. It's well laid out. Besides a few notes that I made I like it a lot overall. I will definitely need to add a home button to mine, that was useful. Nice job!


## [John](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-4/john/projects/e4p/)

1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?
		- Easy to find

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		- So far I like this index page, color scheme is so relaxed, and the contrast is nice.
		- Super clear what to do here and it's not bulky.
		- Links are clear


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		- The forms are clear and visually nice to look at. 

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		- I like how the inputs change to dark color and the characters you type are white. 

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?
		- The "Character Count" does the same thing mine does. I don't think is right because it counts the space between words. If I input "1234 5678" then it should give me 8 character count but it gives me 9. I think you used Strlen function, which is the one I used. I need to find out how Burooj did it because his works.
		- The "Simple Math" has no input so can't do anything there, might want to check that out. 

	- Is the outcome clear?
		- Very clear

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?
		- They match

	- Is it pleasure to use?
		- Yes indeed

	- What could be improved?
		- I've seen a Jesse and Burroj use a return home button, I think you could incorporate one.
		- Check your simple math form and character count form aswell. 


3. **Final Thoughts**
	- I like how simple and clear the directions are on yours. I am going to make my inputs change color when they press in the input box, nice touch, at least I think so. I like how you made the titles big and the directions small, as to not take too much space. 




## Joshua

- unable to find




## [Ned](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-4/ned/projects/e4p/)

1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?
		- Easy to find

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		- I like the colors being used but the font size is hard to read.
		- Links are not clear since they are hard to read due to size and font.


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		- It doesn't say much but you can follow along.
		- It's clear to me

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		- I think the inputs and labels are too small compared to the boxes they are inside. 
		- It is legible

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?
		- The forms work, I wasn't able to break it.

	- Is the outcome clear?
		- The outcome is clear but the way it is displayed is not clear to me. Some have it at the top and some at the bottom so not sure where to look. It could use some padding and font-size could be bigger. Make it more noticeable where the results are and consistant on where they will appear. 

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?
		- Yes they do.

	- Is it pleasure to use?
		- I think it would be if the font was more legible in the index page and in the results.

	- What could be improved?
		- I think font-size and the results would be the things to improve.
		- You could add a return home button like Jesse and Burooj did, make it easier to go back to home page. I plan to add one of those to mine. 


3. **Final Thoughts**
	- I like the font you use in the index but it could be bigger so it is easier to see and appreciate the font you used. I enjoy the the simplicity of it and the colors, it's not boring and it grabs your attention. Just a few things to touch up. Overall great job!




## [Tara](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-3/tara/projects/e4p/#forms)

1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?
		- Easy to find

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		- The index page is pretty bare bones but it has all the information it needs.
		- It is pretty clear what to do here. 
		- Some links open in a different tab, one doesn't and the last link isn't attached to a file I think.
		- Keep how the links open constantly ( how do you get them to open in a different tab, is it an attribute?)


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		- Storytelling is pretty cool, and it's clear what you need to do.

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		- The inputs and labels are clear
		- They could be lined up so it looks cleaner, unless you wanted them to be not aligned. I think visually, it helps if the input boxes are all lined up. 

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?
		- I wasn't able to break any of the forms.
		- The "Counting Characters" does the same thing mine does. I don't think is right because it counts the space between words. If I input "1234 5678" then it should give me 8 character count but it gives me 9. I think you used Strlen function, which is the one I used. I need to find out how Burooj did it because his works.

	- Is the outcome clear?
		- The outcomes are clear but I think it would help if where they are displayed is more consistant.
		- It would help if the results were not so close to the button or inputs. Some padding would help create space there. 

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?
		- Yes

	- Is it pleasure to use?
		- It is 

	- What could be improved?
		- The main thing would be making the results more consistant on where they appear and giving it some padding to push it away from like buttons or labels.


3. **Final Thoughts**
	- I like the style you got going on, just need to apply it to your index page. I like the font you used and the colors you used. Work on formatting that index page and styling it and it will look real nice with the fonts you use. Great job by the way!
