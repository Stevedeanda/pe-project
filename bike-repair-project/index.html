					<p class="content">We've been in the bike repair business for the past 17 years. Our love for bikes started like many of you, just riding, going on trails, and exploring. We had a toolbox full of parts, never when you would need to fix your bike to get back on the trails. People would ask for help and we would gladly help. Since then, we have slowly grown our business of helping those in need.</p>
