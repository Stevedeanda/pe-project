		<h1>My learning journal</h1>

			<p>I've learning quite a lot in the last 23 days. I had almost no experience using a Mac and it's OS system. I like to say that I know how to navigate it with confidence know. Downloaded a few tools that make it easier to do the things I need to do such as <a href="https://mizage.com/" target="_blank">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://evernote.com/products/skitch" target="_blank">Skitch</a>, and <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a>. To name a few, and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> to write the code in. Learn how to organize my folders and files. Declutter is great habit to start practicing and keeping your desktop clean as well. I learn to change the icons on my desktop. Learning HTML at the moment, this is the basics but as we go deeper, I will add more to my arsenal of coding. I'll be able to make amazing things.</p>
