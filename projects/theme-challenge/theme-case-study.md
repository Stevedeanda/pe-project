# Theme Case Study

This is a rough outline for my case study. An overview of my process doing this project.

Goal: Make a website look Pro!

## Rules/Constraints (loose)

- Use a finished HTML template provided by Derek
- DO NOT change the HTML code
- Use CSS to style the HTML code

### Rough Outline

#### Research

1. We all picked our theme for a website and hit the ground running with some research. My theme was **Outdoor Apparel**.
	- I looked at many websites that had to do with the great outdoors. I look at the ones I knew and some I never heard of. 
	- I screenshot a few websites I liked and some I didn't like. I saw many patterns between these stores. The high end apparel companies, with pricier clothes, had a more minimalistic approach to their website. The more budget friendly companies had a lot of content, deals, and ads on their website. 
	- I prefer websites like North Face, REI, Colombia and Patagonia. 
	- They had more modern look to them and it just looked nice overall. 

#### Style Tile

2. Once research was done we moved on to creating a style tile. This part was a rough for me but once I got it, it made sense. 
	- Here we try to put together the style we want for our website. We can make as many as we want to compare and see which one we will do.
	- I grabbed different parts from the different sites I researched that said we are outdoors company. From the colors, fonts, buttons, links, navs, cards, footer, icons, and images they used.
	- Put them together in affinity and it shouldn't look like a layout but more of an ID card, that you will use to identify specific parts of the layout. 

#### Style Code

3. Research is done and Style tile is done. Time to start making the website look pro.
	- We go the code, and I hadn't realized that this was the first time we got code that wasn't ours and worked on it. When I saw Derek's code, I was a bit in shock. 
	- The code was broken down into their own files, it took me a good minute to figure out where everything was at. After going back an forth for a while, I figured out where to find the code I needed to style.
	- I started from the top menu (heading) and worked my way down to the footer.
	- I spent a lot of time on the top menu, trying to get it to do what I wanted with CSS was no joke. Luckily it was on PHP and it was easy to do a hard refresh and see if what you did worked or it didn't. 
	- The first couple days I mainly styled the color, font, and layout. 
	- Once I felt good about it, I posted on slack for feedback. Got a lot of good feedback and went back to update certain things.
	- I shared it with friends and family to see if it was user friendly and get any feedback they had to get it to look pro. Lots of good feedback

#### Details, details, details...details

4. Site was mostly done for the most part, but it wasn't looking pro yet. Here is where we dive into the small details that separate a site looking like a student made it and a pro made it. 
	- I took the feedback I got and applied it. I revisited the research I had done and looked at their small details. 
	- At this point we met up with Derek and he gave us each pointers and advice on what to do next to take it to the next level.
	- **Game Changer** He let us change the HTML.
	- This allowed me to change the logo, add icons and add two modules.
	- I went to affinity designer and started working on my company logo. 
	- This was actually a lot of fun, I did 8 different iterations of my logo in an hour. I could have kept going but had to stop and get back to the challenge. 
	- I also had to take a closer look at the links, buttons, font and how they all looked in pro websites.
	- I put a lot of work on the footer, I like how North Face had their footer at the bottom so I replicated that on mine.

#### Finish?

5. I posted my updated website one more time for some feedback
	- This was good for me because it helped me to find a point in the project where I say I am done. In theory I could keep updating it and updating it as time goes.
	- For now, I posted it and got good feedback. 
	- Showed my friends and family and they were very impressed.

#### Reddit Feedback

6. Lastly, we posted our website on Reddit on a sub called Feedback Friday. 
	- I will wait to see what the reddit community thinks and see if they give me an helpful tips
