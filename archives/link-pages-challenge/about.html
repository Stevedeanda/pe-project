		<h1>Who is Steve?</h1>

		<p>He is a father, husband, son and know a student. I am learning to be a developer at Perputual Education. As you can see, I have built my first project with all the tools I have learned so far.</p>

		<p>You can read most of my story of how I chose <a href="https://stevedeanda.substack.com/p/perpetual-education?s=w" target="blog">Perputual Education</a> online school on my blog post. I've learned more here than I have teaching myself past couple years. It's the structure and mentoring that I was looking for. It's more than just the syntax and coding. It's a way of changing how you think about these concepts and breaking it down to build it back up.</p>

		<p>Some of you may know me or not but here you are. I will be posting more content online, feel free to follow and share my work. Never know if someone looking to hire and might want to hire me. I will later have a place where I will unify all my work.</p>
