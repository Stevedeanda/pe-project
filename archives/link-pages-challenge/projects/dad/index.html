		<h1>New Dad here</h1>

		<p>This has been quite the learning year for me. Been a dad for 5 months and well everyday I seem to be learning something new. I am here to just write somethings that I have found helpful as a new dad. It's a little cute human and a bit overwhelming, one day you got no baby and the next you got a baby. You can prepare all you want but nothing prepares you to the sleep-less nights and feeling of tiredness. Here I am, 5 months later after baby is born, learning to care for my baby and be there for her.</p>

		<h2>Helpful tips</h2>

		<ul>

			<li><h3>Be present</h3>

				<p>As a son of a single mother, I learned at a young age the diffence between a present parent and an absent one. Be there for your partner, they need to know that they aren't not alone. It's not easy raising a little human into the world. They need so much attention, but we can't give them attention all the time. We have meals to cook, jobs, laundry, grocery shopping, shower, and so much to take care of. Being there to help with all these things is a huge help for your partner. Taking care of a baby not a walk in the park, so take turns watching baby while the other does something out of the list of things to do.</p>
			</li>

			<li><h3>Be nicer</h3>

				<p>Mom just gave birth and her body just went throught something men will never understand. I do know that she needs all the support to recover. In these times, it's wise to be nicer. Offer to help her with baby because she will be more tired than us. We have no recovery to go through. If they choose to breastfeed, another thing that is not easy on them. Offer to change diaper, to put baby to sleep. Try to let mom rest as much as she can. Soon she will recover and feel much better. The first couple weeks, be extra nice and helpful. They will appreciate it a lot.</p>
			</li>

			<li><h3>Be loving</h3>

				<p>Love is not a feeling but an action. No one feels like getting up at 2am to a crying baby and see what is going on. We do get up at 2am to a crying baby because we love our babies. We show love with our actions. When we get up early in the morning to take care of baby and let mom sleep an extra hour, that is you showing love to your partner. Love is the things that we do for each other. Now you have an extra person to love on. A father's love will grow as the baby grows to a toddler, kid, teenager, adult and one day a parent themselves. I am getting ahead of myself. My baby is only 5 months and I'm enjoying this time with her.</p>

		<h2>Things I bought</h2>

		<p>A few of the things I bought helped out so much in different areas of the baby so far.</p>

		<ul>

			<li><h3>Stroller</h3>

				<p>I purchased the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/evenflo-pivot-modular-travel-system-with-stroller-38-proseries-litemax-infant-car-seat-aspen-skies/-/A-52194346?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tgtao&DFA=71700000023603947&CPNG=PLA_Baby%2BShopping_Brand_Competitor%7CBaby_Ecomm_Baby&adgroup=SC_Baby&LID=700000001170770pgs&LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&network=g&device=c&location=9061128&targetid=aud-554348709499:pla-894302289990&ds_rl=1242884&ds_rl=1246978&gclid=CjwKCAiAprGRBhBgEiwANJEY7IV1zDz0lR5nIgz4Dis3D19haDIIo89qWW1dQOvFwagkYPcmFwFHeRoCnoMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="stroller">Evenflo Pivot Modular Travel System with Stroller & ProSeries LiteMax Infant Car Seat - Aspen Skies</a> and it's been great for us. We need a car seat for when we leave the hospital, so we decided to get this one since it came with it. It's so easy to put the infant baby seat on to the stroller. Stroller easy to open and put away. It also comes with a bassinet which can be put flat to lay baby down. The bassinet also adjust to be able to sit baby. It's just recently been more useful to us that baby can hold her self up and enjoys seeing her surroundings when we take her out to walks.</p>

			<li><h3>Formula</h3>

				<p>Mom decided to breastfed and I was onboard with her, but now we want to introduce formula to baby. Mom is having a hard time producing more milk and so we have to start looking for formula. During our search, that same week Similac has a formula recall. We actually had Similac formula the baby doctor gave us. I check it and it's part of the recall. We tried different formulas and our baby finally enjoyed drinking one. We went with <a href="https://www.earthsbest.com/product/gentle-infant-formula-23-2oz/" target="formula">Organic Gentle Infant Formula with Iron</a> and it's been great for us. If you aren't sure what formula to get for your baby that is going from breastfeeding to formula, give this one a try.</p>

			</li>

			<li><h3>Baby carrier</h3>

				<p><a href="https://www.honeyroo.com/" target="carrier">Honeyroo</a> is a must have. We had one that was passed down to us and we didn't like it and baby was not a fan either. We looked online and we finally decided to give this one a try and best purchase so far. Baby loves it. We wish we would have had it since the beginning. It is useful in so many ways, rocking baby to sleep, going on walks, getting stuff done around the house and as baby gets heavier your back will thank you having this. We love it and it was a bit pricey but worth it for us. If we going somewhere and don't want to deal with the stroller, we just take this. Baby falls asleep and she is comfortable.</p>
