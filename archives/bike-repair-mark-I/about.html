					<p class="content">Hello and welcome, a little about me and the shop. It all started by just tinkering around when I worked at a non-profit bike spot. One thing that I liked was the culture there. The vibes where homie, friendly and stress-free. That's how it started, now we have a bike shop and years of experience in bike repairs. Our goal is simple, making sure you feel welcomed here and confident that we will repair your bike. We offer a living room for you to relax while we repair your bike, but if you can't wait, we also offer loaner bikes. Feel free to drop by or text us for more information.</p>
