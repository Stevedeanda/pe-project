## [Andy](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-4/andy/projects/e4p/)

1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?
		- Easy to find.

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		- The page could use some formatting, everything is up in the top-left corner.
		- It has an explanation of what the page is for, easy for first time visitors to understand.
		- Links are clear but could use some styling.


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		- Forms are clear.

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		- Boxes are nice and big and the labels are legible.

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?
		- I wasn't able to break it.
		- The Hello World allows me to put symbols and numbers in the box. Not sure if that was on purpose or not.

	- Is the outcome clear?
		- Yes.

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?
		- Yes.

	- Is it pleasure to use?
		- I like to use them, they are eligible and make sense to me.

	- What could be improved?
		- I think the index page could use some styling and formatting.
		- Give the forms some padding at the top so it's not all the way up.
		- The buttons could be made to go with the style you got.

3. **Final Thoughts**

	- I think it looks good overall, It makes sense what you trying to convey and it's legible. Great job!
