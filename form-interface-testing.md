## [Andy](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-4/andy/projects/e4p/)


1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?
		- Easy to find.

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		- The page could use some formatting, everything is up in the top-left corner.
		- It has an explanation of what the page is for, easy for first time visitors to understand.
		- Links are clear but could use some styling.


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		- Forms are clear.

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		- Boxes are nice and big and the labels are legible.

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?
		- I wasn't able to break it.
		- The Hello World allows me to put symbols and numbers in the box. Not sure if that was on purpose or not.

	- Is the outcome clear?
		- Yes.

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?
		- Yes.

	- Is it pleasure to use?
		- I like to use them, they are eligible and make sense to me.

	- What could be improved?
		- I think the index page could use some styling and formatting.
		- Give the forms some padding at the top so it's not all the way up.
		- The buttons could be made to go with the style you got.


3. **Final Thoughts**

	- I think it looks good overall, It makes sense what you trying to convey and it's legible. Great job!

1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?
		- Easy to find

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		- Looks great, not clear what is happening, my wife thought they were exercises for people to do.
		- Maybe a description that they are forms to be filled out and not an exercise they are going to do.
		- Links are clear and fun


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		- It is minimalistic and can be vague. I know what they are suppose to do but I showed my wife and she wasn't sure what to do, she hovered over the "who" and it changed so she clicked on it, but nothing happen. I told her to click on "what is your name" and she was like oh, there is the box. Have the boxes be visible if they hover over "what is your name" or just have them there visible.

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		- They are easy on the eyes and legible. I like them. 

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?
		- I think it would be great if the values stayed put in the "Simple Math", "Retirement Calculator", and "Area of a Rectangular Room", in case they want to edit the number they don't have to re-enter the whole number. 
		- Not a big fan of the clickable feet and meter in "Area of a Rectangular Room", I try to click it but it moves. Have to try multiple times just to click which measurement I want to use. Like it doesn't want to get clicked.
		- I wasn't able to break it. 

	- Is the outcome clear?
		- Yes, I like how it results come out in yellow.

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?
		- Yes 

	- Is it pleasure to use?
		- Yes, I enjoy them.

	- What could be improved?
		- Give it more direction for first time users and the input boxes, visible.


3. **Final Thoughts**

	- I like the animation and detail you put into each part of the project. I am not sure how you got it to show the numbers on the side of each form in the index but that was a nice touch. How you hid the boxes I thought was clever but I can see how some first time users would miss that. I like how the font changes, great use of the hover state. Amazing job!
