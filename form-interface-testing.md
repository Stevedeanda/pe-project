## [Tara](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-3/tara/projects/e4p/#forms).

1. **Index**

	- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at `user/projects/e4p`?

	- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?


2. **Forms**

	- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?

	- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?

	- Does the form work? Can you break it?

	- Is the outcome clear?

	- Do the forms styles match across all forms?

	- Is it pleasure to use?

	- What could be improved?
